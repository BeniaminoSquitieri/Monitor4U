# Monitor4U Home Security Project

## Overview

**Monitor4U** is an iOS application designed to enhance **home security** by providing real-time monitoring of domestic environments. The application aims to alleviate the anxiety and concern that many homeowners feel about potential threats such as **burglary**, **gas leaks**, or **intrusions** when they are not at home. 

The solution integrates advanced monitoring systems and user-friendly features to allow users to manage their home security efficiently from their mobile devices. Key features include monitoring the **air quality** inside the home, detecting the presence of **unauthorized individuals**, and managing multiple residences if needed. The application utilizes **Apple Maps** for location tracking and ensures **privacy** through authentication mechanisms, such as **email** and **Facebook login**.

## Project Structure

1. **Technologies Used**:
   - **Software Platforms**: Visual Studio Code, XCode, GitHub, Figma, and UIzard.
   - **Programming Languages**: Python for the backend and Swift for the iOS application.
   - **Hardware Components**: The project integrates with a control system called **SafeAndCareSystem**, which includes various sensors for detecting gas leaks, vibrations, and intrusions.

2. **System Features**:
   - **Firebase Integration**: For data storage and user authentication.
   - **MQTT Protocol**: Used for real-time communication between the application and the hardware components, ensuring timely alerts and monitoring.
   - **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)**: Designed with **Figma** and implemented with **SwiftUI**, the application provides a smooth and interactive interface for the user.

3. **Challenge-Based Learning Approach**:
   - The project development followed a **Challenge-Based Learning** (CBL) framework, where a real-world challenge was identified and a technological solution was created to address it. This approach encouraged active problem-solving and real-time feedback during the development process.

4. **User Experience**:
   - The user can track their home's security status and air quality directly from the app's **home interface**. If needed, the user can monitor multiple properties and receive instant alerts in case of security threats.

## Conclusion

The **Monitor4U** application represents a comprehensive and modern approach to home security, combining software and hardware to provide users with peace of mind. Future improvements include enhanced authentication features and further integration with smart home systems.
